# Abaqus-CDP-Concrete-Plug-in-Normal-Strength-RC-Dr.-Wahab-
Abaqus/CAE plug-in that automatically generates Concrete Damaged Plasticity (CDP) material definitions for normal-strength concrete from basic input parameters (fᶜ, density, ν, etc.), including nonlinear compression/tension behaviour and damage curves. Developed by Dr. Wahab for research and practical nonlinear RC analysis.
